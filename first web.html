	about me .I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. 
	<p>There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, 
	I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, 
	I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; 
	I like to feel the music flowing on my face, 
	I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, 
	I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. 
	I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. 
	I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, 
	I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; 
	I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. 
	I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. 
	I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.</p>
